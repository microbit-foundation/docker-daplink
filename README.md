```

micro:bit V2.2:

docker run -v $(pwd):/home --rm ghcr.io/microbit-foundation/daplink:2022.01.1 python tools/progen_compile.py -t make_gcc_arm nrf52820_microbit_if
```

micro:bit V1:

docker build -t "daplink-toolchain" .
```

```
docker run --name daplink-toolchain-container -it --entrypoint /bin/bash daplink-toolchain
```


## DAPLink Python dependencies used

These Docker images contain the DAPLink Python dependencies pre-installed as
specified in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

This file is generated by pip installing a DAPLink requirements.txt file and
then pip freezing. This is done because the DAPLink file generally only pins a
few versions and does not include subdependencies.

More info included at the top of the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.


## Versioning

These images use a [CalVer](https://calver.org/) variant: YYYY.MM.MINOR
