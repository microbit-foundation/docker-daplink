# DAPLink Docker Image

üê≥ A Docker image to create repeatable
[DAPLink](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink) builds.


## Building DAPLink with this image

(Optional) You can first pull the image version you want to use:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/microbit-foundation/daplink:2021.12.1
```

Clone and navigate to the desire branch of the DAPLink project:

```
git clone https://github.com/mbedmicro/DAPLink
```

cd DAPLink
```

git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```

Build the required DAPLink project, for example for the `kl27z_microbit_if`:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/home --rm ghcr.io/microbit-foundation/daplink:2021.12.1 python tools/progen_compile.py -t make_gcc_arm kl27z_microbit_if
```


## Building and running this image locally

```
docker build -t "daplink-toolchain" .
```

```
docker run --name daplink-toolchain-container -it --entrypoint /bin/bash daplink-toolchain
```

## DAPLink Python dependencies used

These Docker images contain the DAPLink Python dependencies pre-installed as
specified in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

This file is generated by pip installing a DAPLink requirements.txt file and
then pip freezing. This is done because the DAPLink file generally only pins a
few versions and does not include subdependencies.

More info included at the top of the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.


## Versioning

These images use a [CalVer](https://calver.org/) variant: YYYY.MM.MINOR
